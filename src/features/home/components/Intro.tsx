          Seerakku was born alongside the birth of our baby. We the co-founders,
          SP Dinesh and Janaganandhini D, had our baby girl in the year 2023,
          March 3rd. As we are also filled with a sense of responsibility to
          ensure a safe and sustainable future for our children and for
          generations to come. So, we were planning to offset our babyâ€™s future
          carbon emissions with a food forest.
