        <p>
          Seerakku was born alongside the birth of our baby. We the co-founders,
          Dinesh Kshatriyan ( A Socialpreneur, Sustainable Innovator,
          Environmental Advocate, and Tech Enthusiast) and Janaganandhini D ( An
          Environmental Advocate ), had our baby girl in the year 2023, March
          3rd.
          <br />
          <br />
          As we are also filled with a sense of responsibility to ensure a safe
          and sustainable future for our children and for generations to come.
          So, we were planning to offset our babyâ€™s future carbon emissions with
          a food forest.
          <br />
          <br />
          With the help of farmers in Krishnagiri district Shivalingapuram
          village, I and my wife have planted a thousand trees, shrubs, and
          plants that provide food and habitat for local wildlife and absorb and
          store carbon from the atmosphere, We named this as a NOVA initiative.
          <br />
          <br />
          As our baby grows, the food forest will grow with her, providing a
          constant reminder of the love and hope that inspired the NOVA
          initiative. And that NFT will continue to symbolize the importance of
          individual action in creating a sustainable future.
          <br />
          <br />
          After getting massive satisfaction from doing good for nature and our
          child, we decided to do this for every newborn in India. So we founded
          an NGO called Seerakku ( Seerakku is a Tamil word that means{" "}
          {'"Regulate"'} ).
