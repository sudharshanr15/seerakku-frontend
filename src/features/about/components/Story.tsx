        <p className="mb-5">
          Seerakku was born alongside the birth of our baby. We the co-founders, Dinesh SP and Janaganandhini D, had our baby girl in the year 2023, March 3rd.

        <p className="mb-5">
          We are also filled with a sense of responsibility to ensure a safe and sustainable future for our children and for generations to come. So, we were planning to offset our baby&apos;s future carbon emissions with a food forest.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          With the help of farmers in Krishnagiri district, Shivalingapuram village, my wife and I have planted six thousand trees, shrubs, and plants that provide food and habitat for the local community and absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere. We named this a NOVA initiative.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          As our baby grows, the food forest will grow with her, providing a constant reminder of the love and hope that inspired the NOVA initiative.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          After getting massive satisfaction from doing good for nature and our child, we decided to do this for every newborn in India. So we founded an NGO called Seerakku ( Seerakku is a Tamil word that means &quot;Regulate&quot; ).
