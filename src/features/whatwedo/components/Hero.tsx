For instance, Dinesh SP (Founder) and Mrs Janaganandhini Dinesh became the proud parents of the world's first carbon-neutral baby. They planted 6,000 trees during pregnancy to offset their child’s future carbon emissions. The United Nations has officially recognized our efforts, and our daughter now serves as the Young Green Ambassador for the Green Tamil Nadu Mission." />
